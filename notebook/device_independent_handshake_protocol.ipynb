    "# Device-Independent Handshake Protocol for Verifying Quantum Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "*Test the quantum capabilities of unknown devices.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This handshake protocol outlines a suite of tests to verify various quantum properties. The handshake is implemented by a verifier that wishes to verify an unknown device using a trusted device that is quantum enabled. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "We conisder a bipartite communication scenario involving two connected nodes in a quantum network. Each node has pre-established trust with a Verfier capable of performing a [partial device-independent test](https://chitambarlab.github.io/QiskitSummerJam2020/theory_device_independent_tests.html#partial-device-independent-tests). For convenience the test devices will be given labels Alice and Bob and their respective Verifiers will be labeled with \"A\" and \"B\" respectively.\n",

    "<img src=\"img/handshake_protocol.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    " Verifier A trusts device Alice and Verifier B trusts device Bob. Verifier A first uses its trust of Alice's quantum capabilities to certify Bob's quantum capabilities. Then Verifier B uses their trust of device B to certify Alice's quantum capabilities. If Alice and Bob verify each other to be quantum, then the handshake is successful and Alice and Bob may begin running more sophisticated quantum protocols.\n",
    " \n",
    "Alice and Bob are verified by running device-independent tests designed to distinguish quantum systems from classical. The wavy line connecting Alice and Bob represents the quantum protocol they run to pass tests verify quantum capabilities.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Either Alice or Bob is trusted to perform their quantum tasks without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "A Device is a black-box containing classical or quantum-enabled hardware. The responsibilities of a device include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Executing classical networking protocols to coordinate with other devices.\n",
    "* Faithfully performing instructions passed through classical inputs.\n",
    "* Reliably reporting outcomes through classical outptus.\n",
    "* Accurately reporting its own quantum abilities and error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, quantum devices could use different qubit implementations. It is important for a device to be able publicly share its communication medium. A quantum-enabled device may have various quantum abilities for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparing superposition qubit states for quantum communication.\n",
    "* Performing incompatible measurements on qubit states.\n",
    "* Generating ebits or entangled 2-qubit states.\n",
    "\n",
    "A device is trusted if it can faithfully implement its specified quantum functionality and is known to have no hidden correlations or communication channels with other devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "A Verifier is a classical device that referees device-independent tests. The Verifier's responsibilities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dispatching instructions to test devices.\n",
    "* Analyzing outcome statistics to determine quantum properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dispatched instructions can be understood as quantum circuits to be run on the independent test devices. While running the device independent test, the instructions are drawn randomly froma finite set of possible circuits. The dispatched instructions can be considered inputs $x$ and $y$ within the black-box theory of device independent tests. The Verifier dispatches independent instructions to Alice and Bob and due to the randomness, Alice and Bob are unable to guess the others instruction with any uncertainty. Furthermore, test devices Alice and Bob are not required to know which test they are performing as the Verifier manages the test and the instructions which must be run. \n",

    "## Testing the IBM Quantum Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "We have run the device verification test suite on the IBM quantum computer. The results are reported in the Qiskit Examples page of this website. Our tests should be considered simulations of bipartite quantum communication scenarios, not legitimate verification of quantum behavior. The reason is that Alice and Bob's instructions are being run as part of the same circuit on the same device. This enables classical simulation to suffice for passing the tests as demonstrated by the the Qiskit simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an implementation note, the tests on the IBM quantum computer were not run with random inputs. In a real-world scenario, this might allow a classical device to improve its success against a quantum test.\n",

    "### Potential Exploits\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Network Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical network communications used for coordinating tests between quantum devices should use state-of-the-art security standards for authenticating and securing communication with remote parties. The developed test suite does not guarantee security, however, it helps verify that more sophisticated cryptographic protocols may be implemented.\n",
