The violation requires a single qubit and is not the result of entanglement or nonlocal behavior. The violation is caused by local measurement and superposition alone. For this reason, this test is a great \n",

    "We consider a single qubit scenario where Alice and Bob each have a black-box with classical inputs and outputs. Alice is given an input, $x\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ and encodes the value in a qubit, $\\rho_x$. The qubit is sent to Bob via some channel. Bob is given an input $y\\in\\{0,1\\}$ and performs a projective measurement based on the value. The outcome of the measurement, $b\\in\\{0,1\\}$ is output by Bob.\n",

    "1. Inputs $x$ and $y$ are selected from a uniform random distribution \n",

If no assumptions can be placed on the communication channel, it is necessary to trust either device Alice or Bob to ensure that the prescribed protocol is actually taking place.\n"
