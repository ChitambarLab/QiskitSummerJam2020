    "***A test suite to verify the quantum capabalities of unknown devices.***\n",

    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to deliver a test suite which verifies quantum properties in bipartite communication scenarios. Our tests use measurement statistics to deduce properties such as hilbert space dimension, superpostion, measurement incompatibility, and entanglement. The test suite serves as piece of a broader handshake protocol required to establish trust of an unknown quantum devices. Our protocol is tested using Qiskit and the IBM quantum computers to simulate the bipartite quantum communication scenarios for which our handshake protocol is designed."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum internet will enable long-distance quantum cryptography, teleportation, and distributed quantum computation. Inevitably, long-distance quantum communications will require a large network of intermediary quantum-enabled devices [1]. As the size the size of quantum networks increases, a handshake protocol will be required to establish connections with unknown devices. It will be an important part of this handshake to determine whether a device can faithfully perform simple quantum communications tasks. "

     "abstract": "The internet—a vast network that enables simultaneous long-range classical communication—has had a revolutionary impact on our world. The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. Such a quantum internet may operate in parallel to the internet that we have today and connect quantum processors in order to achieve capabilities that are provably impossible by using only classical means. Here, we propose stages of development toward a full-blown quantum internet and highlight experimental and theoretical progress needed to attain them.",
